# Spoopy-Stories
This website is a collection of creepy/scary stories from around the world. With this site, users can make a collection of their favorite creepy/scary stories or create their own! Users will also be able to leave reviews on various stories.

## Motivation
I wanted a resource to share and show snippets of horror/scary stories. I thought this would be a cool project to work considering the fact I really love horror/scary stories and it would be a nice resource to get a bunch of different stories from all over in one place. 


## General Approach
For this project, I decided that starting out with a basic ERD would be the easiest way to approach it. After drawing out an ERD and stating the relationships between the two tables, I broke the app into two components: An app directory with files to control the back-end and a client directory with files to control the front end. For the backend, I set up a seed file and schema file using rails, where I hard-coded data and used Ffaker  to build the database for testing.

For the client side, which will be the front-end I used create-react-app to create the app.

After creating both a functional front-end and back-end, I used CSS and Bulma to style and format the app.

## Code Example
```react

 determineWhichToRender() {
    const { currentView } = this.state;
    const { stories, selectedStory, selectStory } = this.state;

    switch (currentView) {
      case 'Story Index':
        return <StoryIndex
         stories={this.state.stories}
         detail = {this.getAStory}
         onSubmit = {this.fetchAllStories}
         view={this.fetchAllComments}
         />;
        break;
        case 'Create Story':
        return <CreateStory 
        onSubmit={this.createStory}
        />;
        break;
        case 'Edit Story':
        const story = stories.find(story => story.id === selectedStory.story_id);
        return <EditStory
        onSubmit={this.updateStory}
        story = {story}
        story={this.state.selectedStory}
         />;
         break;
         case 'Story Detail':
         return <StoryDetails
         onClick={this.selectStory}
         story={this.state.selectedStory}
         edit= {this.getAStory}
         delete ={this.deleteStory}
         />;
         break;
         case 'Home Page':
         return <HomePage 
         />;

    }
  }

  handleLinkClick(link) {
    this.setState({currentView: link});
  }


  render() {
    const links = [
      'Story Index',
      'Edit Story',
      'Create Story',
    ];


    return (
      <div>
     <Header 
     onClick ={this.handleLinkClick.bind(this)} 
     links={links}/>
     {this.determineWhichToRender()}
     <Footer />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
